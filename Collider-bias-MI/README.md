# Collider Bias Illustration in Multiple Imputation

This repository contains R scripts for the illustration of collider bias in the context of multiple imputation, based on real-world data from the Stockholm Public Health Cohort (SPHC). The applied example demonstrates how including a collider variable in the imputation model can bias effect estimates in longitudinal studies.
